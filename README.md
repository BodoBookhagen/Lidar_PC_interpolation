# Lidar_PC_interpolation
This repository describes in detail how to interpolate lidar points to a gridded surface using various interpolation methods implemented in GDAL using [gdal_grid](https://gdal.org/gdal_grid.html) and [GMT](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/).

See the [PDF](https://github.com/BodoBookhagen/Lidar_PC_interpolation/raw/master/SCI_Pozo_interpolation_GMT_GDAL.pdf) for more information and a detailed description. 

The folder [gmt5_scripts](https://github.com/BodoBookhagen/Lidar_PC_interpolation/tree/master/gmt5_map_scripts) contains a folder with GMT5 scripts to generate maps and different maps.
